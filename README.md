# oai2linerec
Shell script for harvesting metadata records from OAI-PMH repositories. 

Records are aggregated in a single file, serialized to a single record per line. Optionally, individual records can be compressed to save space.

For an example of how to process such a single linerec output file, see companion script parselinerec.sh.
For speeding up the processing of linecrec file with shell scripts see [A beginners guide to processing 'lots of' data](http://datatopia.blogspot.nl/2015/10/a-beginners-guide-to-processing-lots-of.html).
